## 5. Rationale for Distribution:
<!-- - **Core Team Exclusion from Direct Earnings:** 
  - Core team members do not receive a percentage from individual project earnings to ensure that they focus on high-level tasks and strategic decisions rather than on project-based earnings. This helps maintain their role as leaders and advisors within the group. -->
  
- **Project Hunter's Incentive:** 
  - The project hunter receives a significant percentage (20%) to encourage them to actively seek out and secure new projects for the group. This incentivization helps in growing the group's portfolio and income.

- **Sustainability of the Group Fund:** 
  - Contributions to the Group Fund from each role ensure that the group can sustain itself operationally, allowing for reinvestment in tools, resources, and opportunities for all members.

- **Equitable Reward for Contributions:** 
  - This structure aims to reward members based on their contributions and responsibilities while maintaining fairness in how earnings are distributed.
